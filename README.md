## Compiling

If you want to jump straight into it, simply run,
````
make test
````
This compiles ped, and opens the file `test` in ped.

If you simply want to compile ped, simply type,
````
make
````

This creates the ped binary in `bin/ped`, then,
````
./ped <filename>
````
Will open `<filename>` in ped.
